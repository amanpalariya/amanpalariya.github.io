I bet you must have come across LaTeX (📢 LA-tek) once in your lifetime. It's a beautiful piece of typesetting software based on TeX. A shoutout to Donald Knuth!

Like our beloved Linux kernel and Git VCS, it's a member of the popular and influential open-source software family.

People learning LaTeX can't imagine using it casually. And I made it my second nature. LaTeX was my go-to tool for making notes, writing assignments, and preparing slides.

Let me show you a fraction of my LaTeX-y notes and assignments. Get ready for [“The Why”](/blogs/latex-story-2-why) and [“The How”](/blogs/latex-story-3-how) next.
