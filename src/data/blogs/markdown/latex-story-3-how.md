I came across @Gilles Castel's blogs on note-taking with LaTeX. Those were the inspiration and the foundation of my obsession with LaTeX.
For a newcomer, those blogs can be overwhelming.
But I knew a bit of LaTeX, was using Ubuntu and thanks to Dr @Sudarshan Iyengar, vim was already a tool in my arsenal.

So, the combination of TeX Live, Neovim, vimtex, UltiSnips, and a lot of practice made me a LaTeX pro. I was the LaTeX handyman among my friends.

After setting up snippets according to the subject at hand, I could type equations faster than I could write.

Reach out to me freely, if you want to learn more about the process. And again, Gilles Castel's blogs are a goldmine if you want to dive into this.
