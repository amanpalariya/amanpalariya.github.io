LaTeX is unintuitive. The spaces don't work like spaces, the commands have a syntax like no other language, the special characters often keep you busy debugging your code, adding images already requires a package (don't even talk about floats to a newcomer), adding a ₹ still requires a hack, and the list goes on.

**Still worth it**

Besides so many downsides, LaTeX is still something I'm proud to have befriended. My eyes lit up when I compiled my first equation to PDF with LaTeX - zooming in to see the smooth vectors. My foremost experiments with LaTeX were offline, and set up locally on my PC, which made the compilation and debugging quick.

Then I just kept learning - basic typesetting, tables, images, colors, tikz, commands, bibliography, etc.

**The benefits**

- Beautiful result.
- Faster than writing. Always for text, with practice for equations, though rarely for figures.
- Can be tracked with Git.
- Easy to modify later.

Again, some more examples from my notes and assignments.
