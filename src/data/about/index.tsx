I'm a software engineer at Oracle, focusing on backend systems for Oracle Integrations (OIC).
Over the past two years, I've worked on features ranging from Kubernetes cost-saving designs to low-level protocols like SSH/FTP, and have also gained experience in CI/CD, DevOps, and development engineering.
I've also worked with healthcare standards like HL7 FHIR, driven by product demand in that industry.

I use AI tools almost every day to automate various processes, such as resolving simpler bugs, managing release changes, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines. I've built tools to streamline these workflows and improve team productivity.

I graduated from IIT Ropar with a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. During college, I interned at Oracle and Newzera.

I'm passionate about tech, education, linguistics, and social causes. I participate in Oracle's volunteering activities and look for opportunities to contribute meaningfully outside of work. In my spare time, I enjoy solving puzzles like Sudoku and Crosswords.

I look forward to transition from being an individual contributor to a leader. I also want to explore the world of entrepreneurship in fields of my interests.
